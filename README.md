Back-Propagation
================

This repository contains Java files required to implement back propagation in a feed forward neural network for functions like XOR,NOR,NAND,PALINDROME etc

Run the Classifier_Function_name file for back propagation
on the console it will ask for inputs, like the no. of inputs to the boolean function
the learning rate
the momentum etc
